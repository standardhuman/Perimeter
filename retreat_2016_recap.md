#### Updates
- Our ops will start Sunday at 0600.
- Trucks:
  - We will have 9 trucks.
  - 1 will be assigned to Zip.
  - 3 will have the Wifis.
  - 3 will go to Bee prior to burn weekend.
- Julija is a slut. However, if we have the budget and it helps free up Yando and me to be available for troubleshooting, I say we put her in an SL slot.

#### Action to take
- [ ] Email Julija with her status. Who should do this?
- [ ] Slack vs. Email list: Slack is for developing plans. Email list is for announcing them.
  - [ ] I will email everyone individually with this clarification.

- [ ] Active shooter protocol:
  - [ ] I will ping JoJo for the resources she offered and discuss with you two.

- [ ] Schedule:
  - [ ] Calculate needed shifts per SL and of what type. I can do most of this. Input welcome.
    - Tentative requirements: 1 LH, 2 Graves,

- [ ] How to handle SLUTS.
  - [ ] Slut slot vs SLP slot on schedule. I've submitted a request to Magpie to add an SLT slot to the schedule with only access for the three of us and our two sluts: JoJo and What She Said.

- [ ] Determine LC status for myself. I'll contact Ira.
- [ ] Squids for Lighthouse. Need to email...office?

- [ ] GIMP: I will email Formica and JoJo to initiate their collaboration on the most useful GIMP fields for Perimeter and for Formica to thin the available fields to those.
  - [ ] How to get Formica access to GIMP?
- [ ] Conference with Yando on Ghostrider scheduling.
- [ ] Add to Scout => SLUT promotion criteria:
  - [ ] Multitasking
  - [ ] Familiarity with closure rules
  - [ ] Clarify the Perimeter Mission. Let's put it in writing, if it isn't already, and start message it to our scouts pre-shift.
